PROJECT OVERVIEW
- This project uses linear regression to predict the delivery days for e-commerce orders based on dataset features such as the purchase hour and the purchase day of the week, it is part of my machine learning practice exploring supervised learning using python

Language - Python 
Libraries used - Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn


OBJECTIVES

To analyze e-commerce order data
To build a linear regression model to predict the delivery times
To predict actual vs predicted delivery days
To evaluate the model performance using metrics like the RÂ² score and the mean squared error(MSE)

KEY LEARNING POINTS

Data pre-processing using pandas and numpy
Exploratory data analysis(EDA) with seaborn and matplotlib
Building and evaluating regression models with scikit-learn
Understanding model performance and overfitting


HOW TO RUN
Clone the repository from GitHub to your local computer.

Install the required Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.

Open the Jupyter Notebook located in the notebooks/ folder.

Run all the cells in the notebook to train the model and view the results.
